# Project 455 Server Documentation

## Press Play

That's right! Start the executable and give your clients your 
IP that will show in your terminal.

## Logging

Standard logs will be in white and errors will appear in red.
Errors will be logged in the server and sent to the client.

## Request Response Model

The Server Client pair uses an in-house communication method
that passes serialized request and response objects to each other.
This helps protect data and makes error handling easy.
